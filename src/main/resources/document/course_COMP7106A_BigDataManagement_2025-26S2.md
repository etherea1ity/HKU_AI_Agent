   Course Code: COMP7106ACourse Name: Big Data ManagementInstructor: Reynold C.K. ChengSemester: Semester 2, 2025-26 Academic Year (tentative)Category: Postgraduate (MSc(CompSc))Pre-requisites: The student is expected to have taken a course on introduction to databases (e.g., COMP3278), and has some background in statistics and calculus.Compatibility: Students who have obtained credits for any of the following courses are not allowed to take COMP7106: 1. COMP7107 Management of complex types; 2. COMP7105 Advanced topics in data science; 3. COMP7801 in the academic year 2019-20, 2020-21Moodle Course Website: [TBA]
2. Course Introduction
   The course will study some advanced topics and techniques in Big Data, and survey the recent development and progress in specific areas in big data management and scalable data science. Topics include but not limited to: large database management techniques, spatial data management and spatial networks, data quality and uncertain databases, top-k queries, graph and text databases, and data analytics.
   Advances in big data technologies have led to an explosion of data volume and complexity. This course equips students with core skills to manage and analyze large-scale data—covering both theoretical foundations (e.g., uncertain data modeling) and practical techniques (e.g., spatial data query optimization)—preparing them for roles in data engineering and scalable data science.
3. Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs)
   CLO1: Able to understand the background and knowledge of some advanced topics in Big Data that have become key techniques in modern database theory and practices.CLO2: Able to understand the background and knowledge of some contemporary topics in Big Data research (e.g., uncertainty data management, text, and graph databases).Programme Learning Outcomes ReferencesView Programme Learning Outcomes - MSc(CompSc)
