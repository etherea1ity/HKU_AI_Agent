2. Course Introduction
   This course covers several topics in AI and ML. It starts with traditional AI techniques including search, probability estimation, and Bayes rule, then moves to machine learning techniques such as unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and supervised learning. AI and ML are highly interdisciplinary fields with impacts in applications like biology, robotics, language, economics, and computer science. AI is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs, while ML refers to changes in systems that perform AI-related tasks. Ethical issues in advanced AI and methods to prevent learning algorithms from acquiring morally undesirable biases are also covered.
3. Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs)
   CLO1: Understand the fundamental concepts of computational intelligence and machine learning
   CLO2: Demonstrate awareness of the major challenges and risks facing computational intelligence and the complexity of typical problems within the field
