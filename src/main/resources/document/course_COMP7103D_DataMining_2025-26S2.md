2. Course Introduction
   Data mining is the automatic discovery of statistically interesting and potentially useful patterns from large amounts of data. The goal of the course is to study the main methods used today for data mining and on-line analytical processing, including Data Mining Architecture, Data Preprocessing, Mining Association Rules, Classification, Clustering, OLAP, and Advanced Data Mining (Web, Spatial, Temporal data).
   Advances in data collection and generation technologies are producing massive amounts of data from which valuable information and knowledge can be derived. This course covers various data mining techniques—powerful tools for data analysts to process data and extract interesting patterns and models—enabling new scientific discoveries and intelligent business decisions.
3. Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs)
   CLO1: Understand the knowledge discovery process, which includes data collection, data cleaning, model building, model testing and evaluation.CLO2: Understand the various data mining tasks and the fundamental algorithms for achieving those tasks.Programme Learning Outcomes ReferencesView Programme Learning Outcomes - MSc(CompSc)View Programme Learning Outcomes - MSc(FTDA)
