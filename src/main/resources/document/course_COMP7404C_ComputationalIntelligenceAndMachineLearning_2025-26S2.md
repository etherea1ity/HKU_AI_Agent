2. Course Introduction
   This course will teach a broad set of principles and tools that provide the mathematical, algorithmic and philosophical framework for tackling problems using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). AI and ML are highly interdisciplinary fields with impacts in applications like biology, robotics, language, economics, and computer science. AI is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs, while ML refers to changes in systems that perform AI-related tasks. Ethical issues in advanced AI and methods to prevent learning algorithms from acquiring morally undesirable biases are also covered.
