2. Course Introduction
   More and more data are available through automatic collection tools in various formats. As data volume and variety increase, data processing systems need specialized indexing and query evaluation techniques for complex and composite data management. This course studies the management of non-traditional and complex data types beyond relational tabular data. It first provides background on classic indexing and query evaluation methods for relational databases, then covers techniques for complex data types including spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal data; multidimensional feature vectors; sparse vectors and set-valued data; strings, sequences and time-series; general and knowledge-base graphs; geo-social and geo-textual data. It also covers data storage methods for disk and main-memory.
3. Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs)
   CLO1: Understand the nature of complex data and the challenges in managing and querying composite data objects in main memory and on the disk
   CLO2: Learn popular techniques for managing and searching spatial, temporal, spatio-temporal, multidimensional point data, time-series, strings, and sequences
   CLO3: Learn techniques for representing and accessing large-scale sparse and dense sets, graphs and knowledge bases; Learn access methods and search algorithms for composite data (geo-textual and geo-social)
