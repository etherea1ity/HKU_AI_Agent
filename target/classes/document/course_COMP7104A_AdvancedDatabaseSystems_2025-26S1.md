2. Course Introduction
   We are living in the Big Data era, with virtually all innovation domains (medicine, finance, sports, physics, astronomy, etc.) becoming data-rich. Traditional database management systems (originally designed for efficient business data processing) have evolved rapidly, and new systems have emerged to support diverse data-intensive applications with specific characteristics and requirements. These applications are often characterized by the four "Vs" of Big Data: Volume (data size), Variety (data formats), Velocity (e.g., streaming sources), and Veracity (uncertain data, data reliability). Their requirements may relate to data storage architecture (e.g., cloud-based), fault tolerance, or flexibility of data/computation models. This course studies advanced topics and techniques in database systems, focusing on database design & algorithms and big data processing for structured data. Traditional topics include query optimization, physical database design, transaction management, crash recovery, and parallel databases. It also surveys recent developments in areas like NoSQL databases and SQL-based big data management systems for relational (structured) data. The course reviews data processing architectures and algorithms for managing large data quantities, covering both transactional processing and data analytics.
3. Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs)
   CLO1: Understand trade-offs in database systems techniques, able to apply acquired knowledge on the state-of-the-art in modern data management for designing holistic solutions based on database systems and techniques, justify design decisions in the context of a data management solution
   CLO2: Able to implement and evaluate complex, scalable database systems solutions, develop new methods in databases based on acquired knowledge of existing techniques
